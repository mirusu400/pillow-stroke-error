# What is stroke error?
When we draw a font with specific font, it gets `invaild argument` Error.
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Users\User\Documents\_github\drawfontimage\core.py", line 180, in create
    draw.text(
  File "C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39\lib\site-packages\PIL\ImageDraw.py", line 457, in text
    draw_text(stroke_ink, stroke_width)
  File "C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39\lib\site-packages\PIL\ImageDraw.py", line 408, in draw_text
    mask, offset = font.getmask2(
  File "C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39\lib\site-packages\PIL\ImageFont.py", line 676, in getmask2
    self.font.render(
OSError: invalid argument
```
But I don't know which font gets error, so I just make simple test scripts to check even the font gets error.
